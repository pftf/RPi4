Subject: [PATCH 1/1] MdeModulePkg/UefiBootManagerLib: Signal ReadyToBoot on
 platform recovery

Currently, the ReadyToBoot event is only signaled when a formal Boot
Manager option is executed (in BmBoot.c -> EfiBootManagerBoot ()).

However, with the introduction of Platform Recovery in UEFI 2.5, which may
lead to the execution of a boot loader that has similar requirements to a
regular one, yet is not launched as a Boot Manager option, it also becomes
necessary to signal ReadyToBoot when a Platform Recovery boot loader runs.

Especially, this can be critical to ensuring that the graphical console
is actually usable during platform recovery, as some platforms do rely on
the ConsolePrefDxe driver, which only performs console initialization after
ReadyToBoot is triggered.

This patch fixes that behaviour by calling EfiSignalEventReadyToBoot () in
EfiBootManagerProcessLoadOption (), which is the function that sets up the
platform recovery boot process.
